            Christ is my reward
            <br>
            And all of my devotion
            <br>
            Now there’s nothing in this world
            <br>
            That could ever satisfy
            <br>
            Through every trial
            <br>
            My soul will sing
            <br>
            No turning back
            <br>
            I’ve been set free

            Christ is enough for me

            The joy of my salvation
            <br>
            And this hope will never fail
            <br>
            Heaven is our home
            <br>
            Through every storm

            [Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
            <br>
            Thought I found a way
            <br>
            Thought I found a way out (Found)
            <br>
            But you never go away (Never go away)
            <br>
            So I guess I gotta stay now
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish & Khalid]
            <br>
            Oh, I hope some day I’ll make it out of here
            <br>
            Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
            <br>
            Need a place to hide, but I can’t find one near
            <br>
            Wanna feel alive, outside I can’t fight my fear
            <br>
            [Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
            <br>
            Isn’t it lovely, all alone?
            <br>
            Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
            <br>
            Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
            <br>

            Walking out of time

            Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)

            Something’s on my mind
